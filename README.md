#AI Powered Revenue Distribution System

Overview
The AI-Powered Revenue Distribution System is an advanced decentralized application that creates an AI-driven digital cultural icon, guiding users in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space. This digital twin interacts with users, co-authors content, and engages in community projects while continuously learning from user interactions. Leveraging the GAIA AI model, the system processes diverse revenue streams—such as subscription fees and content sales—and utilizes smart contracts to automate the equitable distribution of revenue. Revenue is shared quarterly among stakeholders, the community, and operating costs for maintenance. This system AI mimics a financial advisor.
